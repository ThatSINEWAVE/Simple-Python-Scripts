# Hangman Game

</div>

### Description:
This Python script implements a simple Hangman game where the player has to guess a word by guessing individual letters. The player has limited attempts to guess the word.

### How to Use:
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. The script will choose a random word from a predefined list of words.
3. You will be presented with underscores representing the letters of the word to guess.
4. Guess a letter by entering it when prompted.
5. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
6. If the letter is incorrect, you will lose an attempt, and the hangman drawing will progress.
7. Keep guessing letters until you correctly guess the word or run out of attempts.
8. If you correctly guess the word, you win! Otherwise, you lose the game.

### Note:
The game uses a predefined list of words as the word pool. 
You can customize this list by modifying the `choose_word()` function in the script and add as many words as you like.
